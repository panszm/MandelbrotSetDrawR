# MandelbrotSetDrawR
A simple desktop java app to view Mandelbrot Set as the name states.
It allows to center view on a certain point and zoom on it.
The window consists of three fields (to enter x,y coordinates and zoom), button (to refresh image), and the canvas that let's the user see the output.
Main class which we use to start the program is MandelWindow. The constructor has 2 arguments precision and bounds. Precision stands for number of iterations of the Mandelbrot Set formula, while bounds is the radius of set.
